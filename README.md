- Types of bias and their sources
- Fairness definitions and trade-offs

### 2. Pre-Audit Preparation
- Stakeholder identification
- Data understanding and assessment
- Risk assessment framework

### 3. Audit Methodology
- Step-by-step audit process
- Metric selection and calculation
- Testing procedures and validation

### 4. Analysis and Interpretation
- Results interpretation guidelines
- Fairness-accuracy trade-off analysis
- Contextual considerations

### 5. Reporting and Action Plans

- Monitoring and continuous improvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with data analysis tools (Python/R recommended)
- Access to the AI system or dataset to be audited

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souhaila-DJAFFAL/Fairness-Audit-Playbook.git
cd Fairness-Audit-Playbook
```

### Quick Start Guide
1. Review the foundational concepts section
2. Complete the pre-audit checklist
3. Follow the step-by-step audit methodology
4. Use provided templates for documentation
5. Implement recommended remediation strategies

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Fairness Assessment
```python
# Example code snippet for basic fairness metrics calculation
# (Actual implementation would depend on your specific use case)

from fairness_audit import FairnessAnalyzer

analyzer = FairnessAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.evaluate_model(model, test_data, protected_attributes)
analyzer.generate_report(results)
```

### Comprehensive Audit Workflow
1. **Initialize Audit**: Define scope, stakeholders, and success criteria
2. **Data Analysis**: Examine training and test datasets for bias indicators
3. **Model Evaluation**: Apply multiple fairness metrics and statistical tests
4. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze potential real-world implications
5. **Documentation**: Create a comprehensive audit report with recommendations

## 🔍 Fairness Metrics Covered

- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes
- **Group Fairness**: Equal treatment across different demographic groups
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups
- **Calibration**: Equal prediction accuracy across different groups

## 📊 Reporting Features

- **Executive Summary**: High-level findings for stakeholders
- **Technical Analysis**: Detailed statistical results and methodology
- **Visual Dashboard**: Charts and graphs for data visualization
- **Action Items**: Prioritized list of recommended improvements
- **Compliance Mapping**: Alignment with regulatory requirements
